				    Happy Birthday Dumpling.......
                    You bring to me a happiness that no one else  could. You bring to me a love I have never known before. I could not imagine what my life would be like without you. I love being with you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Every day I wake up thanking God for you. You have given me so much, and I don't know if I will be able to give back all that you have given me. You have been my guiding light when I was lost. You have been my rock. Sometimes I feel lost and out of touch, but when you're there, I feel safe. Your voice soothes me. I could sit here and try to tell you just how I feel, but I can't find the words other than I am ecstatic we met and have gotten together after all we've gone through.

I want to tell you that the love I have for you is undying. It is a love that is strong and enduring and will stand the test of time. I truly feel blessed that you have become a part of my life, and I cannot wait for the day that we can join our lives together I promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart. I will always be here for you when you need me, and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my soul mate, and I vow to love you all eternity.

Meeting you was fate. Becoming your friend was a choice but falling in love with you, was beyond my control. If I could give you one thing in life,

I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes only then you would realize how special you are to me.
I love you always and forever. Wrap yourself up in this blanket and consider it a big hug!!
Once again ...Happy Birthday ‚ù§Ô∏èmy baby , my dumpling, my mushroom,my tisku, my everything üòäüòò
